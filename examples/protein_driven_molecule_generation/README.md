# Protein-driven molecule generation

You can use the `PaccMann<sup>GP</sup>` model, a VAE pretrained on drug-like compounds from ChEMBL, to generate molecules with high binding affinity to a desired protein.
`PaccMann<sup>GP</sup>` relies on Gaussian processes to navigate a static latent space of the pretrained VAE.

Say, you are interested in discovering potential inhibitors of the [JAK1 kinase (UniProt ID: P23458)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P23458). Then, leverage `PaccMann<sup>GP</sup>` as follows:

```py
from gt4sd.algorithms.controlled_sampling.paccmann_gp import PaccMannGPGenerator, PaccMannGP
configuration = PaccMannGPGenerator()
target = {
    "affinity": {"protein": "LGEGHFGKVAKELVLMEFLPSGERNLGDL"}
}
paccmann_gp = PaccMannGP(configuration=configuration, target=target)
items = list(paccmann_gp.sample(10))
```

If you were simultaneously interested to optimize other properties like QED or SCScore, define this in your target specification.
You can also add weights to each component of the multi-objective. 

```py
target = {
    "qed": {"weight": 1.0},
    "sa": {"weight": 2.0},
    "affinity": {"protein": "LGEGHFGKVAKELVLMEFLPSGERNLGDL"}
}
```
