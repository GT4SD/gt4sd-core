# Enzyme Optimization in Biocatalytic Reactions

This repository provides an example on how ro run the framework for the optimization of enzymes within the context of biocatalytic reactions.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the enzyme optimization process, execute the following command in your terminal to activate the environment:

```console
conda activate gt4sd
```

## Running the example

To run the example simply type:

```console
python example_enzeptional.py
```
