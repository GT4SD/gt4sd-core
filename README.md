The GT4SD (Generative Toolkit for Scientific Discovery) is an open-source platform to accelerate hypothesis generation in the scientific discovery process. It provides a library for making state-of-the-art generative AI models easier to use.

For full details on the library API and examples see the [docs](https://gt4sd.github.io/gt4sd-core/).

## Installation

### requirements

Currently `gt4sd` relies on:

- python>=3.7,<3.8
- pip>=19.1,<20.3

We are actively working on relaxing these, so stay tuned or help us with this by [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project.

### conda

The recommended way to install the `gt4sd` is to create a dedicated conda environment, this will ensure all requirements are satisfied:

```sh
conda env create -f conda.yml
conda activate gt4sd
```

And install the package via `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gt4sd/):

```sh
pip install gt4sd
```

**NOTE:** In case you want to reuse an existing compatible environment (see [requirements](#requirements)), you can use `pip`, but as of now (:eyes: on [issue](https://github.com/GT4SD/gt4sd-core/issues/31) for changes), some dependencies require installation from GitHub, so for a complete setup install them with:

```sh
pip install -r vcs_requirements.txt
```

### Development setup & installation

If you would like to contribute to the package, we recommend the following development setup:

```sh
conda env create -f conda.yml
conda activate gt4sd
# install gt4sd in editable mode
pip install --no-deps -e .
```

Learn more in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Getting started

After install you can use `gt4sd` right away in your discovery workflows.

### Running inference pipelines in your python code

Running an algorithm is as easy as typing:

```python
from gt4sd.algorithms.conditional_generation.paccmann_rl.core import (
    PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator, PaccMannRL
)
target = 'MVLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTT'
# algorithm configuration with default parameters
configuration = PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator()
# instantiate the algorithm for sampling
algorithm = PaccMannRL(configuration=configuration, target=target)
items = list(algorithm.sample(10))
print(items)
```

Or you can use the `ApplicationRegistry` to run an algorithm instance using a serialized representation of the algorithm:

```python
from gt4sd.algorithms.registry import ApplicationsRegistry
target = 'MVLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTT'
algorithm = ApplicationsRegistry.get_application_instance(
    target=target,
    algorithm_type='conditional_generation',
    domain='materials',
    algorithm_name='PaccMannRL',
    algorithm_application='PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator',
    generated_length=32,
    # include additional configuration parameters as **kwargs
)
items = list(algorithm.sample(10))
print(items)
```

### Running inference pipelines via the CLI command

GT4SD can run inference pipelines based on the `gt4sd-inference` CLI command.
It allows to run all inference algorithms directly from the command line.

You can run inference pipelines simply typing:

```console
gt4sd-inference --algorithm_name PaccMannRL --algorithm_application PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator --target MVLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTT --number_of_samples 10
```

The command supports multiple parameters to select an algorithm and configure it for inference:

```console
$ gt4sd-inference --help
usage: gt4sd-inference [-h] [--algorithm_type ALGORITHM_TYPE]
                       [--domain DOMAIN] [--algorithm_name ALGORITHM_NAME]
                       [--algorithm_application ALGORITHM_APPLICATION]
                       [--algorithm_version ALGORITHM_VERSION]
                       [--target TARGET]
                       [--number_of_samples NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES]
                       [--configuration_file CONFIGURATION_FILE]
                       [--print_info [PRINT_INFO]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --algorithm_type ALGORITHM_TYPE
                        Inference algorithm type, supported types:
                        conditional_generation, controlled_sampling,
                        generation, prediction. (default: None)
  --domain DOMAIN       Domain of the inference algorithm, supported types:
                        materials, nlp. (default: None)
  --algorithm_name ALGORITHM_NAME
                        Inference algorithm name. (default: None)
  --algorithm_application ALGORITHM_APPLICATION
                        Inference algorithm application. (default: None)
  --algorithm_version ALGORITHM_VERSION
                        Inference algorithm version. (default: None)
  --target TARGET       Optional target for generation represented as a
                        string. Defaults to None, it can be also provided in
                        the configuration_file as an object, but the
                        commandline takes precendence. (default: None)
  --number_of_samples NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES
                        Number of generated samples, defaults to 5. (default:
                        5)
  --configuration_file CONFIGURATION_FILE
                        Configuration file for the inference pipeline in JSON
                        format. (default: None)
  --print_info [PRINT_INFO]
                        Print info for the selected algorithm, preventing
                        inference run. Defaults to False. (default: False)
```

You can use `gt4sd-inference` to directly get information on the configuration parameters for the selected algorithm:

```console
gt4sd-inference --algorithm_name PaccMannRL --algorithm_application PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator --print_info
INFO:gt4sd.cli.inference:Selected algorithm: {'algorithm_type': 'conditional_generation', 'domain': 'materials', 'algorithm_name': 'PaccMannRL', 'algorithm_application': 'PaccMannRLProteinBasedGenerator', 'algorithm_version': 'v0'}
INFO:gt4sd.cli.inference:Selected algorithm support the following configuration parameters:
{
 "batch_size": {

  "title": "Batch Size",
  "default": 32,
  "type": "integer",
  "optional": true
 },

  "type": "string"
 }
}
```

### Running training pipelines via the CLI command

GT4SD provides a trainer client based on the `gt4sd-trainer` CLI command. The trainer currently supports training pipelines for language modeling (`language-modeling-trainer`), PaccMann (`paccmann-vae-trainer`) and Granular (`granular-trainer`, multimodal compositional autoencoders).

```console
$ gt4sd-trainer --help
usage: gt4sd-trainer [-h] --training_pipeline_name TRAINING_PIPELINE_NAME
                     [--configuration_file CONFIGURATION_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --training_pipeline_name TRAINING_PIPELINE_NAME
                        Training type of the converted model, supported types:
                        granular-trainer, language-modeling-trainer, paccmann-
                        vae-trainer. (default: None)
  --configuration_file CONFIGURATION_FILE
                        Configuration file for the trainining. It can be used
                        to completely by-pass pipeline specific arguments.
                        (default: None)
```

To launch a training you have two options.

You can either specify the training pipeline and the path of a configuration file that contains the needed training parameters:

```sh
gt4sd-trainer  --training_pipeline_name ${TRAINING_PIPELINE_NAME} --configuration_file ${CONFIGURATION_FILE}
```

Or you can provide directly the needed parameters as argumentsL

```sh
gt4sd-trainer  --training_pipeline_name language-modeling-trainer --type mlm --model_name_or_path mlm --training_file /pah/to/train_file.jsonl --validation_file /path/to/valid_file.jsonl 
```

To get more info on a specific training pipeleins argument simply type:

```sh
gt4sd-trainer --training_pipeline_name ${TRAINING_PIPELINE_NAME} --help
```
